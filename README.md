Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods
 

The objective of our project is to develop a comprehensive tutorial on Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation targeted at students and professionals interested in its applications across disciplines such as finance and statistics. Our tutorial aims to provide a detailed explanation of MCMC concepts, practical numerical examples, and insights into real-world applications.
